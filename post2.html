              A man and his wife have allegedly been arrested by the Operatives of the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Akwa Ibom State Command, for trying to sell their daughters aged six and four.
The suspect identified as Elisha Effiong alongside his wife were apprehended in Uyo November 15 after reports got to the agency  that the couple were trying to sell their daughters Abasifreke Edet and Rachael Edet for the sum of N700,000

Umana Ukeme the public relations officer of the command revealed in a statement on November 23 that the couple stated that the reason for their decision to sell their children was because of the hardship in the country.



 
The statement reads in part: “The suspect, Elisha Edet Effiong, ‘M’ was apprehended with his two children identified as Abasifreke Edet, 6, and Rachel Edet, 4, while attempting to sell them for M700, 000 in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.

“Effiong, 40 years was apprehended at FulCare Hospital along Ekpanya Street, where he notified the security guard of his intention to sell his two children to pay off his debt and meet other financial challenges.

“The security guard notified the NSCDC and immediately, Commandant Abidemi Majekodunmi detailed personnel of the anti-human trafficking unit of the corps who swung into action and apprehended the suspect alongside with his two daughters.”
